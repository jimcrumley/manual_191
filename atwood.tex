\section*{Before Lab}

It is straightforward to show, using Newton's laws, that the
acceleration $a$ of the system of masses shown Fig.~\ref{fig:atwood}
below is given by
\[
 a = {{M - m} \over {M + m}}\; g
\]
  where $g$ is the
acceleration of gravity and $M$ and $m$ the two masses.
  In your lab notebook, you should make a
careful force diagram for each mass and derive this result.
See your textbook or your instructor if you need help.  We will want
to compare the predictions of this
equation to the experimental results we obtain in this experiment.

An Atwood machine is a device that uses weights and pulleys to test
Newton's second law, and to find the acceleration of the system of
masses shown Fig.~\ref{fig:atwood}.  In this experiment, we will use
the computer to record the
velocity of the masses as a function of time.  From these data, we can
calculate the acceleration.

Increasingly, scientists and engineers use computers to acquire data
automatically from experiments.  In this experiment, we will introduce
a hardware and software system designed by Pasco Scientific, which
allows us to 
%connect interface hardware through an SCSI port, and 
record data from a wide
range of apparatus automatically, using the Pasco ``Science
Workshop'' software for Windows.  We will use this same system in
other experiments in this course.



\section*{Apparatus and Procedure}

Please note first of all that the Pasco ``smart pulley" is fragile.
Be careful in working with it!  {\bf In particular, be sure that you
choose
a length of string such that it is impossible for the upward-moving
weight to strike the pulley!}

First notice how the pulley works.  There is a beam of light that
passes from one side of the pulley to the other.  As the pulley turns,
this light beam is interrupted by one of the pulley spokes, and a
signal is transmitted to the computer.  Thus, this system measures
directly the time from one interruption of the light beam to the next.
Since the pulley has ten spokes, we are measuring the time it takes
for the pulley to move through an angle of $36^\circ$ --- 1/10 of a
circle. If
we know the radius of the pulley, it is not hard to calculate how fast
the string on radius of the pulley is moving as the pulley turns.
We will be talking about how to do this calculation later in the
semester; but see if you can figure it out now.

{\bf NOTE:} The Pasco software uses a built-in ``calibration constant"
to convert these times into linear velocities.  Unfortunately, this
calibration constant is given to only two significant figures.  As a
result, there may well be a systematic uncertainty in the velocities
(remember our discussion from the Reaction Time experiment about the
difference between systematic and random uncertainties).

After your lab instructor shows you how the apparatus works, take some
time to become familiar with it.  See how the string fits over the
pulley, hang some masses from each end, and do a few test runs.  It
is probably best to keep accelerations reasonably small.  Here
are a few guidelines:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mount the pulley as high on the vertical rod as you easily can.
Be
sure the rod is stable, and does not tend to shake or vibrate easily.
%
\item Do not hang a total of more than about 600 grams from the pulley
(both sides).
%
\item Note that the larger the total mass, and the smaller the
difference
between the two masses, the smaller the acceleration should be.
%
\item {\bf Be absolutely sure, before you do any test runs, that your
string
is long enough that the upward-moving mass cannot strike the pulley! }
\end{itemize}

\section*{Taking the Data}

Here are some guidelines for taking a set of velocity vs.\ time data,
from which you can calculate the acceleration.
Use these guidelines to develop your own procedure, {\bf and describe
that
procedure in comprehensive detail in your lab book, WHILE YOU ARE IN
THE LAB TAKING THE DATA.}

We will take data for two separate sets of masses.  Try to choose
values for which the accelerations differ by at least a factor of two;
but keep both accelerations reasonably small.

For each set of masses, take four separate sets of data.  Thus, you
will have a total of 8 runs for this experiment.

Guidelines for taking data:
\begin{itemize}
\item Measure the masses carefully on the digital balance.  If you are
using more than one mass for either $m$ or $M$, measure the masses
together---do not measure the individual masses and add them later.
Why?
%
\item Set up the two masses on the string.  The lower mass should be
as close to the floor as possible.
%
\item Develop a procedure for releasing the masses---be sure they do
not have a tendency to sway as they move.
%
\item One should person click the RECord button on the Pasco screen, then the
other person releases the masses.
As soon as the descending mass
strikes the floor, click on the stop button.  You should now have a
set of data for velocity vs.\ time.   Examine the data on the graph in
the Pasco Science Workshop program, and be sure you understand how to
use it to find the acceleration of the masses.
%
\end{itemize}

\section*{Data Reduction and Analysis}
\subsection*{Using Linfit to find the acceleration}

We will move the data to Linfit to find the acceleration, using the
data for velocity vs.\ time that you have already recorded.  To do so:
\begin{itemize}
\item Start up Linfit.
%
\item Go back to the Pasco program, and select only those velocity vs.
time data that you want to fit.  Note that as you select the data on
the graph, it is also selected in the table. Select (click on) the table window.
%
\item Select ``Copy" from the Edit menu.
%
\item Now switch to Linfit, and pull up the spreadsheet.  Put the
cursor in the top left cell, and Paste your data into Linfit.
%
\item You will be taking eight sets of data.  
It is a good idea to save this file to disk frequently.
%
\item Select your data on the spreadsheet, move it to the data screen,
and do your least-squares fit to find the acceleration.
\begin{itemize}
\item For the uncertainty in velocity, use 0.003 m/sec.
(This estimate is based on limited experience; let your instructor
know if your reduced chi-squared value seems off.)
%
%\item Parameter estimates: Use your theoretical value of the
%acceleration for the slope; for the intercept, choose zero, since the
%initial speed of the masses will be small.
\end{itemize}
%
\item You do not need to print your fit; but do go back to the
spreadsheet, and from the Data menu, choose Data/Get Fit Results from
Fit Screen.  This step will open a new worksheet.  It might be easiest
to cut the slope and its uncertainty (the parameter $B$) and paste it
into the same worksheet with your data.
\end{itemize}

{\bf For each data set, you
should, at this point, have a value of acceleration, and the
uncertainty in the acceleration, from your least-squares fit.}

You
might also want to record your two masses on this worksheet, and
calculate the theoretical value of the acceleration.  Put enough text
in the worksheet so readers can easily see what each number
represents.  Include units, of course!


\subsection*{Uncertainty in the acceleration}
The uncertainty in each acceleration, which you obtain from your
least-squares fit, applies to that particular run.  But are there
variations from one run to the next?  We will investigate that
question in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
\item For each set of masses, collect the four values of the
acceleration that you found from your least-squares fits.
%
\item Calculate the average acceleration, the standard deviation, and
the standard deviation of the mean (see Appendix A, page~\pageref{sdev.mean}).
Note that the standard
deviation of the mean should represent the uncertainty in the
average acceleration.

As a check, see if the standard deviation of the mean is
consistent with the uncertainties from your least-squares fits.  (Note
that you can use a spreadsheet function to calculate the standard
deviation---see the on-line help.)
%· In addition, calculate the standard deviation of the mean.  What additional information does this quantity give you?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Analysis of the uncertainty in the theoretical value of
the acceleration}

As noted above, the theoretical value of the acceleration is given by

\[
 a = {{M - m} \over {M + m}}\; g
\]
We will want to compare this theoretical value with your experimental
values.  In order to do so, we must know the uncertainty in the
theoretical value based on the measured uncertainties in the masses
$M$ and $m$.  It turns out to be fairly difficult to calculate the
uncertainty in the acceleration $a$ using the techniques developed in
Appendix A of the lab manual,
so we will do it ``experimentally."  Change each mass (up and also down) by the measured
uncertainty (0.1 gm, for the digital balance that we use) and see what
happens to the acceleration.  Half the difference between the largest
and smallest calculated values of acceleration is a rough estimate of
the uncertainty.

\section*{Table of Results and Conclusion}

In most experiments, it is important to summarize all your
experimental results in your conclusions section.  For each set of
masses, make a table that includes
\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\alph{enumi})}
\item  the theoretical value of the acceleration, with uncertainty;
%
\item your value of the acceleration for each of your four runs with
that set of masses, with uncertainty (these values are the ones from
the least-squares fits); and
%
\item the average value and standard deviation of the mean for the
four measurements.
\end{enumerate}
If you want to, you can make this table up on a spreadsheet workbook,
and tape it into your lab notebook.
As always, put in enough text so that it can be read easily by someone else.
Make sure you display the proper number of significant digits
in these final reported results!

In your conclusion, you should discuss, separately for each set of
data, whether the theoretical and experimental values for the
acceleration agree, within the uncertainties of the experiment.  You
should also discuss whether the uncertainties in the least-squares
fits, in (b), are consistent with the standard deviations calculated
in (c).  If they are not, are there sources of systematic error that
might account for such an inconsistency?  (One is mentioned
above---the
calibration constant of the ``smart pulley;" what other systematic
errors might be present in this experiment?)
