The ability to collect useful data (and estimate the accuracy of that data) and the ability to
analyze data (interacting with and interpreting the results of programs like excel/WAPP) are
two key skills we hope to develop in this course.  This lab practical exam will test
the most straightforward skills: namely interacting with and interpreting the results
of computer programs.  In this exam you will be given a dataset and told the appropriate functional
form, and you will:

enter this data into a spreadsheet (including numbers in scientific notation)
transfer the data to WAPP (having set the proper y-error and functional form). All the datasets
assume no x error and generally (but not always) there is a simple formula for y-error.
interpret the resulting parameters (including proper units, sigfigs, and error)
calculate some quantity based on those parameters (i.e., error propagation as in )
self document your spreadsheet calculations

Your work product for this exam includes:
A quick report card, that properly reports (units, sigfigs, error) the functional parameters  
and calculated parameters (5 points)
hardcopy of the WAPP fit report (1/2 point)
In most cases: two hardcopy plots (one with normal scales, and one in which scales have been chosen
which linearize the curve).  The quadratic functional form cannot be linearized
and the linear functional form is linear using normal scales, so in those cases you need only turn in
one hardcopy plot. (2 points)
Hardcopy of your spreadsheet showing the dataset and specified calculations which should be
self-documented in the spreadsheet. (2 points)

You will staple all of these sheets together and turn them into the lab instructor (1/2 point).
Your lab notebook is not required for this exam.  You may use this lab manual and the textbook
as references during this exam.
