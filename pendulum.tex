%THE PENDULUM
\newexp

       This experiment is, among other things, an exercise that
 allows you to devise your own experimental procedure and method
 of data analysis.

       You will be given a timer, a length of cord, a weight, and
 some clamps and assorted hardware.  Using this equipment, find
 how the period of a pendulum depends on its length.

       After you have finished this part, do a theoretical
 analysis of the pendulum, using your text if necessary, and use
 your results to find $g$, the acceleration of gravity.  Include a
 discussion of experimental uncertainty.

       Your writeup should include a detailed description of your
 experimental procedure, and a discussion of how you applied the
 techniques of graphical and computer analysis to your data.
